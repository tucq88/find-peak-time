# Find peak time

Inspired by this [article](https://blog.trello.com/find-productive-hours), and this [quote](https://www.workboard.com/images/resources/workboard-drucker-lg.jpg).

Currently there's no convenient app that helps you finding your peak time in a day (only excel file). So this app is intend to be very good at it, by:
- After you register, you commit to track your time for, at least, 1 week
- System will
    - notice your timezone,
    - sending notification every 1 hour from x to y in a day (you defined)
    - allow you to log your last hour quickly
    - have report at end of the day, end of the week... tell lot stories about your peak time
- And more - in future, system will
    - work as a personal tasks management
    - include with a simple timer for tasks
